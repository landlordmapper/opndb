# opndb
Open Property Network DB

Very WIP!!

# Todo:
- [x] init uv environment - should be easy for data scientists to start project and get good environment
- [x] Create directory for data schema v0.1 (pydantic?)
- [ ] ruff formatting / cicd / etc -- only need this when more than one contributor, maybe

- Create gui / webapp repo

# how to run
- install uv on your computer
- `uv run -m opndb.schema.20250207_init` as example
